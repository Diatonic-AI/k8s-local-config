- `tls.key` - Private key
- `ca.crt` - CA certificate (self-signed)

---

## 🌐 Ingress Configuration

### TLS Section
```yaml
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - llama3.daclab-ai.local
    secretName: llama3-tls-cert
```

### Annotations
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: selfsigned-issuer  # ✅ Updated from letsencrypt-prod
```

### Access URLs

| Endpoint | Protocol | URL |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Chatbot Adapter | HTTPS | https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/chatbot/ |
| Code Adapter | HTTPS | https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/code/ |
| RAG Adapter | HTTPS | https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/rag/ |
| Microservices Adapter | HTTPS | https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/architecture/ |
| Base Model | HTTPS | https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/base/ |
| Health Check | HTTPS | https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health |

---

## 🧪 Testing HTTPS Access

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test with certificate verification skipped (self-signed)
curl -k https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok"} or similar
```

### Test with Certificate Verification
```bash
# This will show certificate warning (expected for self-signed)
curl https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health

# Output will be:
# curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
```

### Browser Access
1. Open: https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health
2. You'll see: "Your connection is not private" warning
3. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to llama3.daclab-ai.local (unsafe)"
4. This is **normal** for self-signed certificates

---

## 🔧 Why Self-Signed Certificates?

### Reason for Self-Signed
- `.local` domains are **not publicly routable**
- Let's Encrypt **requires public DNS** and HTTP01 challenges
- Self-signed is **perfect for internal/development** use
- Still provides **TLS encryption** for secure communication

### Let's Encrypt Status
```bash
$ kubectl get clusterissuer letsencrypt-prod -o yaml | grep -A 3 "status:"

status:
  conditions:
  - message: 'Failed to register ACME account: Get "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)'
    reason: ErrRegisterACMEAccount
    status: "False"
```

**Why it fails:** Control node cannot reach Let's Encrypt servers (expected for internal cluster)

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What's Secure
✅ **Traffic is encrypted** end-to-end with TLS  
✅ **Private key is secure** (stored in Kubernetes Secret)  
✅ **Certificate auto-renewal** configured (cert-manager)  
✅ **Wildcard support** for subdomains  

### What's Not Trusted (By Design)
⚠️ **Browser warnings** - Certificate is not signed by a trusted CA  
⚠️ **Manual trust required** - Clients need to accept the self-signed cert  
⚠️ **Not for production** - Use proper CA-signed certs for production  

### This is NORMAL for:
- Development environments
- Internal corporate networks
- Local testing and validation
- Private Kubernetes clusters

---

## 📥 Trust Certificate (Optional)

If you want to avoid browser warnings, you can install the certificate as trusted:

### Linux
```bash
# Extract certificate
kubectl get secret llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > llama3-cert.crt

# Install to system trust store
sudo cp llama3-cert.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates

# Verify
curl https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health  # Should work without -k
```

### macOS
```bash
# Extract certificate
kubectl get secret llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > llama3-cert.crt

# Add to Keychain
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain llama3-cert.crt
```

### Windows
```powershell
# Extract certificate
kubectl get secret llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter `
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > llama3-cert.crt

# Import to Trusted Root
Import-Certificate -FilePath llama3-cert.crt `
  -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

### Browser-Specific (Firefox)
Firefox uses its own certificate store:
1. Go to: Settings → Privacy & Security → Certificates → View Certificates
2. Click "Import" and select `llama3-cert.crt`
3. Check "Trust this CA to identify websites"

---

## 📋 Verification Commands

### Check Everything
```bash
# cert-manager health
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

# ClusterIssuers
kubectl get clusterissuer

# Certificate status
kubectl get certificate -n llama3-multi-adapter
kubectl describe certificate llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter

# TLS Secret
kubectl get secret llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter

# Ingress TLS config
kubectl get ingress llama3-multi-adapter-ingress -n llama3-multi-adapter -o yaml | grep -A 5 "tls:"

# Test HTTPS endpoint
curl -k https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health
```

### Expected Output Summary
```
cert-manager pods:        3/3 Running ✅
ClusterIssuers:           selfsigned-issuer READY ✅
Certificate:              llama3-tls-cert READY ✅
TLS Secret:               llama3-tls-cert exists ✅
Ingress TLS:              Configured ✅
HTTPS endpoint:           Responding ✅
```

## 🔄 Certificate Lifecycle

### Auto-Renewal
cert-manager will automatically renew the certificate:
- **Issued:** 2025-10-02
- **Expires:** 2025-12-31 (90 days)
- **Renewal:** 2025-12-01 (15 days before expiry)
- **Process:** Automatic, no manual intervention required

### Manual Renewal (if needed)
```bash
# Force certificate renewal
kubectl delete certificate llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter

# cert-manager will automatically recreate it
kubectl get certificate -n llama3-multi-adapter
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ SSL/TLS fully configured
2. ✅ Test HTTPS endpoints
3. ⏭️ Load Llama3 models into pods
4. ⏭️ Test inference over HTTPS

### Optional Improvements
1. **Add monitoring:** Set up alerts for certificate expiry
2. **Trust certificate:** Install cert on client machines
3. **DNS:** Add llama3.daclab-ai.local to internal DNS
4. **Upgrade path:** Plan for Let's Encrypt if going public

### For Production Deployment
If you later expose this to the internet:
1. Get a public domain name
2. Point DNS to your ingress IP
3. Update ingress annotation to `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod`
4. Let's Encrypt will issue a trusted certificate automatically

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Certificate Not Ready
```bash
# Check certificate status
kubectl describe certificate llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter

# Check certificate request
kubectl get certificaterequest -n llama3-multi-adapter

# Check cert-manager logs
kubectl logs -n cert-manager -l app=cert-manager
```

### Browser Still Shows Warnings
**This is normal and expected for self-signed certificates!**

Options:
1. Click "Advanced" and proceed (adds exception)
2. Install certificate in system trust store (see above)
3. Accept that dev/internal systems show warnings

### HTTPS Not Working
```bash
# Verify ingress has TLS configured
kubectl get ingress -n llama3-multi-adapter -o yaml | grep -A 5 "tls:"

# Verify secret exists
kubectl get secret llama3-tls-cert -n llama3-multi-adapter

# Test connectivity
curl -k -v https://llama3.daclab-ai.local/health
```
