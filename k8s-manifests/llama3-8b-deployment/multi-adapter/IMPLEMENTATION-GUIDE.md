# Multi-Adapter LLM System - Implementation Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Old deployment torn down**  
‚è≥ **Redesign in progress** - New manifests needed  
üìã **Requirements understood** - Chatbot, RAG, Code, Microservices

## Critical First Step: Enable GPU Time-Slicing

Your system has **2 GPUs** but needs to run **7+ pods**. GPU time-slicing allows multiple pods to share each GPU.

### Step 1: Configure NVIDIA Device Plugin

This is CRITICAL and must be done before redeploying.

I've created the complete redesign plan in `REDESIGN-PLAN.md`. 

## What Needs To Be Built

### 1. GPU Time-Slicing (MUST DO FIRST)
- Configure NVIDIA device plugin
- Allow 4 replicas per GPU
- Test with simple pod

### 2. Updated Manifests
- Fix OLLAMA_MODELS paths
- Correct resource requests (0.5 GPU, not 1 full GPU)
- Add proper environment variables

### 3. New Adapters
- **Chatbot**: General conversation
- **RAG**: With vector search integration
- **Code**: Code generation/completion
- **Microservices**: Architecture design

### 4. Proxy Layer
- Nginx with CORS headers
- Path-based routing
- Rate limiting
- SSL/TLS support

### 5. Vector Database
- Deploy Qdrant for RAG
- Configure storage
- Create collections

## Recommendation

This is a **significant redesign** that requires:

1. **~2-3 hours** to implement properly
2. **GPU time-slicing setup** (requires node configuration)
3. **Complete manifest rewrite**
4. **Testing each adapter**
5. **CORS and routing setup**

### Option A: Full Implementation (Recommended)
I can create all manifests now, but they won't work until GPU time-slicing is enabled.

### Option B: Incremental Approach  
1. First: Set up GPU time-slicing
2. Second: Deploy one adapter to test
3. Third: Deploy remaining adapters
4. Fourth: Add proxy/CORS
5. Fifth: Add SSL

### Option C: Use Your Current Single Deployment
Scale up your existing `ollama-llama3` deployment in the `llama3` namespace and add a proxy in front of it.

## What Would You Like To Do?

1. **Enable GPU time-slicing first** (I'll provide exact commands)
2. **Create all new manifests** (ready to deploy once GPU config is done)
3. **Test with simple deployment** (validate GPU sharing works)
4. **Go back to single deployment** (simpler, add proxy/CORS only)

Let me know your preference and I'll proceed accordingly!
